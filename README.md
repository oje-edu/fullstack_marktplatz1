# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
## test frontend ##
# first run
npx hardhat node
# in a second terminal run
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
npx hardhat help
```
